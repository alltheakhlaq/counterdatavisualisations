There was a continuous anxiety about the enslaved people devising non-violent and violent ways to fight the inhumane practice of their enslavement. Resistance has always been a primary feature against colonial endeavours–often enough the colonial gaze tries to minimise them or reframe them as less powerful based on their magnitude. However, digging deep into the archives and collections, and reading them against the grain illustrates the persistent nature of these revolts against colonialism. The previous section illustrates the ways in which Sloane engaged with Slavery, and the brutality that it engendered. Equally important is to highlight the resistance that was continuously put up by the enslaved people to fight the colonial and white supremacist brutality. This text espouses the ideology that there is no failed resistance or failure in the practise of resisting, the fact that there is even an attempt at subjugation and disruption of colonial power in itself constitutes as success, even if the ultimate destination of complete tarnish is not reached.",e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsxs("mark",{"data-context-tag":"object",style:{background:"#FFB8EBA6"},children:["Object:"," "]}),"Miscellanies Entry 1796: ‘A bullet used by the runaway negros in Jamaica made of the pewter dishes & lead in a thimble When there is too much tinn they break in pieces on being shott. M r . Barham.’ Jamaica held the most number of uprisings of enslaved people in the Caribbean (Jackson, 2024). This object in Sloane’s collection illustrates different ways in which enslaved people were putting up resistance by employing and modifying everyday household items in the houses of their enslavers. Digging further into the history of these objects could connect it to a wider network of slave resistances and anti-colonial struggles. It could illustrate the deep roots that resistance to slavery has, and how its always been an intrinsic part of history of transatlantic slave trade.",e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("mark",{"data-context-tag":"medical practices",style:{background:"ABF7F7A6"},children:"Colonial domination: Medical practices which enslaved people were subjeted to"}),'Although Sloane’s complicity in enslaving people, and his participation in transatlantic trade of enslaved people is acknowledged, the historical biographies of Sloane often talk about him treating them equally in his medical practice (Churchill, 2005; more citations). What this set of literature fails to consider is the level of violence entailed in an enslaved person being brought for treatment by their captor to a medical practitioner who is part of the colonial ranks. Oscar Wilde talks about ‘good’ slave holders in his text by stating “Just as the worst slave-owners were those who were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the system being realised by those who suffered from it, and understood by those who contemplated it, so, in the present state of things in England, the people who do most harm are the people who try to do most good" (Wilde, 1891). Sloane’s attitude towards enslaved people does not rectify his complicity and involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, if anything, that makes him even more dangerous for those resisting the enslavement of people – as he presents an apparently ‘non-violent’ side of the slavery which on face value presents a persona which appeal to the moral values of Western ideologies but is inflicting horrid harm to Black and indigenous population in the colony.',e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("mark",{"data-context-tag":"colonial anxiety",style:{background:"ABF7F7A6"},children:"Resistance: Colonial anxeity: Instilling fear in the heart of the enslavers"})," ","x"," ",e.jsx("mark",{"data-context-tag":"banning music",style:{background:"FF5582A6"},children:"Domination: Banning of musical instruments for fear of revolt"}),"The magnitude of colonial anxiety regarding slave revotls could be further illustrated by Sloane himself in the first volume of his book ‘Natural History of Jamaica’. Writing about banning certain kinds of trumpets and musical instruments in Jamaica, Sloane mentions the reason being ‘it was thought too much inciting them to Rebellion, so they were prohibited by the customs of the Island’. The prohibition of a musical instrument in case it pushes people to revolt against the slave holders indicates the level of dread that colonisers felt towards chances of resistance. However, this dread wasnt unfounded. There was resistance put up by people within enslavement or having escaped it. Although from a colonial gaze, Sloane’s writing points to the frequency of its occurrence in the colonies, and the dread it instilled in the hearts of the whites.",e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("mark",{"data-context-tag":"direct attack",style:{background:"ABF7F7A6"},children:"Resistance: Primary resistance/Breaking resistance - direct physical attacks on enslavers or those perceived as colonisers"}),"In the second volume of his book, Sloane mentions avoiding certain areas around the plantation where he had heard a lot of escaped enslaved people would ambush the White people who would be passing by. This camouflaging and attacking White people was called ‘dodging’, it was a tactic employed by escaped enslaved people to sabotage the perpetrators of colonialism. Another instance of the uprising of enslaved people in Jamaica around the time Sloane was there was when the enslaved people captured guns from their captors and shot 15 white people. Although this is in no way an exhaustive list of resistance of enslaved people during Sloane’s time in Jamaica against White supremacy and its various oppressions, it serves as a way of shedding light of different ways in which the colonised and brutalised have always resisted against their dehumanisation. Kellie Carter Jackson (2024) talks about five different legitimate ways in which enslaved people have resisted White supremacy: revolution, protection, force, flight, and joy. Munira Khayyat (2022), speaking of resistance in a different context, of those who live in South Lebanon bordering with Israel, defines it as life’s insistence on returning even after the extreme ravages of destruction caused by war. Some of these resistances make their way into colonial texts, and some don’t. History of resistance goes as far back as history of colonisation–whether their existence is recorded or not. **"]});export{s as b,i as g,a as i,o as m,n as s};
